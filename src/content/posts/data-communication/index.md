這份筆記（除了 Queueing Theory 的 Week 9 章節）曾作為資料通訊修課時期末繳交的作業。

老師在課堂給我們的作業提示：

> If you take a look at our grading policy, you will notice that 10% of your course score will come from your composed study notes for this course. The intention here is that we would like to encourage everyone to compose a collection of materials that you can take away from this course and bring with you in your future endeavors in related fields. That being said, by simply **composing what I will deliver in class** you will receive a major portion of this 10 points, but if you can and will **include something from your own thoughts or your own study of the subject**, you will receive more.
